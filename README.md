# three-bedroom-two-bath-home-in-Essex-Junction
This three bedroom two bath home in Essex Junction has a very rare backyard which backs up to undeveloped woodland for wildlife, especially deer! There is a nice deck for morning coffee and an inground pool for afternoon and evening cocktails to enjoy all summer long! The 20 year solar panels are transferable and are on the one side of the roof and have saved money on the electric bill for sure. There are original hardwood floors in the living room, hallway and bedrooms, and ceramic tile in the kitchen and bathroom. The main floor primary bedroom features two large closets. The very spacious family room on the lower level has a walk out patio door to the backyard. There is also an extra office space for those that work at home. The laundry is located on the lower level as well. One of the many projects are all new easy clean pull-out windows, newer doors and many new light fixtures. This is a wonderful Essex Junction location!Hi
